# Wonyun Trench Run

* **Genre**: Shump/Bullet-hell
* **Platform**: [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).
* **Language/Framework**: Lua (Pico-8 subset)

A videogame made in/with/for [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). This is the complete version of [Project Wonyun](https://github.com/JunoNgx/Project-Wonyun), a [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) project which was close to completion but, but was abandoned at some time in 2014.

**Wonyun Trench Run** focuses on a group of pilot stationed at the titular Wonyun outpost, who encountered an invasion and decided to one by one make the run through the siege to alert the mothership.

The game was meant to be part of a much larger universe spanning across multiple titles, but like most fantasies in life, they were never made.

Besides gamedev as what I absolutely love and another project to hone my skills, this game was a satisfying closure to my old and incomplete past.
